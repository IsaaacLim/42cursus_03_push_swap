# 42cursus_03_push_swap 🃏

## Grades: 109/100

Method used: [Radix sort](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/push-swap-tutorial-fa746e6aba1e)

Tried using [this sorting method](https://medium.com/@jamierobertdawson/push-swap-the-least-amount-of-moves-with-two-stacks-d1e76a71789a) but failed to implement it correctly

For bonus, we can read strings line by line until `ctrl+C` is pressed using [this method](https://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/121561-read-strings-line-line-until-ctrlplusc-pressed.html)
